on the Day:
* exchange vacuum cleaner filter for the clean one for vacuum molding
* detach vacuum cleaner hose 
* remove vacuum cleaner bag
* attach vacuum molding table hose to vacuum cleaner
* clean heating rods with paper and isopropanol
* inspect all visible cables for visible damages
* lay the extension cooord from workshop to case
* check with cultorga/culttech what needs to be switched off (matelight/media-pc/amps/atem), before you can unplug theire cable. only then plug in the extension coord
* get IR-thermometer, stopwatch, notepad and pen
* go to toilet

right before the first molding

* clamp sheet
* position molds
* plug in vacuum cleaner
* switch on oven-thermometer, adjust set-temp to 150°C
* unlock main switch (from here on you must stay in direct vicinity off the machine at all times!)
* check if heating elements are switched off
* check if vacuum cleaner switch is off
* check if the three automatic Over-Current circuit breakers are on
* check if Residual-Current Circuit Breaker is on
* switch on main switch
* press test button on RCCB
* switch RCCB off and then to on position
* move up clamping frame in heating-position
* switch on both oven parts and start the stopwatch
* check temperature every 10-20sec
* wait until the material is sufficiently soft, saggy and hot
* release the clamping frame
* have someone write down the exact time from the stopwatch
* switch on vacuum cleaner
* move clamping frame down on the mold
* switch off oven
* wait until plastic is cooled below 70°
* switch off vaccuum cleaner
* release plastics from mold


for any other molding after the first
